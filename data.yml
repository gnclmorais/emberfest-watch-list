  - title: "Universal Design: A new process for better apps"
    description: "In this talk, you will learn about Universal Design: what it is and what it isn't; the principles behind Universal Design; how it's already being used in other industries; and how you can apply some of these principles while building your apps for improved outcomes for all users."

  - title: "{{should-avoid this.renderModifiers butHow=true}}"
    description: |
      The ember-render-modifiers README states that the modifiers are ‚Äúvery useful for quickly bridging the gap between classic components and Glimmer components, but they are still generally an anti-pattern.‚Äù It also says that you should ‚Äúrethink your functionality rather than use these modifiers as a crutch.‚Äù.

      However, the README doesn‚Äôt give any real guidance on what we should do instead.

      In this talk I‚Äôm explain why these modifiers are problematic and explore the two main use cases I‚Äôve seen ember-render-modifiers used for and how we can go about replacing them with modern Ember patterns that will set us up for success in the future. And finally, after this talk, we‚Äôll have a resource to which we can point future engineers when they scratch their heads about how to avoid these modifiers.

  - title: Building a phygital platform with Ember.js
    description: Have you ever been to a museum where you used an app or touchscreen to deep dive into a subject? At Ocular, we build phygital applications for museums and showrooms, all with Ember.js. This talk will cover how we started with Ember.js, and how we went from physical installations to virtual showrooms.

  - title: Two Ember Apps Become One
    description: |
      Have you ever imagined how you would be challenged to embed one Ember app inside another? Well, if you have, then you‚Äôre in luck and if you haven‚Äôt, buckle up, because it‚Äôs gonna be a weird 30 minutes!

      Just like every developer, here at Phorest, we are all dealing with the impact of legacy code. In turn this can lead to difficult decisions, but even more creative solutions. While migrating our entire system to a browser only product, we found a solution to embed our older Ember application into our current Ember application via‚Ä¶ you guessed it‚Ä¶ an iframe.

      With the tale of two apps becoming one, we can deliver a browser product to our users faster than ever. Alongside this, we will discuss the technical decisions made from rooting between the two applications all the way to standardising styles. What seemed impossible in the beginning now is a seamless experience of one magical Ember application inside another.

  - title: Bootstrap your dashboard the right way
    description: |
      Drawing on the web has never been straightforward, and multiple standards have been emerging to adress that complexity. Whether you decide to opt for the versatility of HTML canvas, or keep closer to the scalability and resilience of SVGs, choosing the right library to fulfill all product requirements can be dreadful.

      What are the critical questions to address when building a dashboard? How to keep accessibility in mind? And first of all, which library should you go for when working with Ember?

  - title: Automated Visual Testing in Ember
    description: |
      Ember gives developers the power to write tests and be confident about deployments. But have you ever made a change that broke your application layout while still passing all tests?

      In this talk we‚Äôll explore the world of visual testing to keep your app pixel perfect and have that peace of mind when deploying. By the end, you should be able to understand how visual testing works and how to set it up in a reliable way, even for applications with complex data structures and time dependent logic.

  - title: Performance culture. New opportunities with Embroider
    description: |
      Performance culture is a unique culture that is not often seen among companies. Only the ones that care enough and invest time in it can see the benefits. Up until Embroider was released, the Ember community, even if wanted to embrace performance culture, wasn't able to actually iterate on the results.

      In my talk, I'll go through the goals we've set and how we accomplished some great results by using Embroider and Webpack. Our journey is not finished but I already have a bunch of tricks and prescriptions for you. I'll show what are the tools we use to make sure we keep the quality high.

  - title: Test as if you're in someone else's shoes
    description: |
      Having Ember historically so closely modelled to Ruby on Rails, it is easy to also apply the same approach in writing tests for both. What has been shown in the last 10 or so years is that backends are fundamentally different from frontends. This fundamental difference also requires a fundamentally different approach to thinking about and writing tests. This shift in thinking can be difficult or underestimated by developers who come from a Rails/backend background, which is the case for plenty of Ember developers. The result is a vast and diverse pool of tests written using different patterns.

      At Intercom we have done testing with and without thinking about the user first. Inevitably a code base being worked on by many engineers brings many different patterns together. This results in a highly diverse test suite that a lot can be learned from. Taking stock of whatever is present and seeing how we can improve upon what exists following a set of guiding principles makes Intercom an org with ever improving code quality. This talk will bring some real world examples of patterns (good and bad) that live within the Intercom codebase today. We will (potentially) go over some refactoring of these real world examples to solidify the learnings and principles outlined in the talk. With anecdotal evidence it becomes easier to see the power and value of user centric testing.

  - title: Move Fast and (Don't) Break Things by Gon√ßalo Morais
    description: |
      Feature flags are a common way to deploy ongoing work into production and keep it under radar until it is ready to be put in front of our users. The thing is: there is more thought that should be put into this practice, it‚Äôs not just about flipping a switch to turn a feature on. Developer experience can be greatly affected if a team doesn‚Äôt come up with processes around how to manage feature flags in an agile process.

      Cleaning up feature flags gets forgotten and complexity accumulates. And how about tests, how do you make sure all paths get properly covered? I will cover the good, the bad, and the ugly aspect of feature flags, how we can put them into place effectively and, as a bonus, the extra benefits we get from this.

  - title: A framework for ambitious companies
    description: |
      When we started building Qonto, we knew that the default path of piling up features would lead to a codebase where it's hard to implement changes and easy to create bugs. That's why we adopted Ember.js. The framework provided us with stable foundations and consistent practices, making it technically easy for our team of 50 engineers to build new features or make improvements in any domain of our apps.

      Similarly, we know that the default path of growing a company by specializing teams leads to Big Company Disease. Attempts to create economies of scale cut the connection with customers. Focus shifts to defining scopes, setting up procedures, and standardizing work. Agile withers to solidified processes and tools, with little care given to individuals and interactions. Team mood suffers.

      What if we had a framework?

  - title: Bottled Ember - Batteries Included Web Framework, tiny tiny living space
    description: |
      All Ember addons come with the concept of a ‚Äúdummy app‚Äù. This has been super useful to test our addons and has even been part of the reason why we have been able to support so many different versions of Ember from a single addon using ember-try scenarios. This talk gives a bit of detail on how things work with ‚Äúclassic‚Äù V1 addons and dummy apps and talks a little bit about why this can‚Äôt work for new Embroider V2 addons.

      I will then go into a detail on a particular setup that could bring the simplicity and magic of dummy apps to the standards focused Embroider world. This should make it super easy for developers to tests their apps in all the versions of Ember that they want to.
